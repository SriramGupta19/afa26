# [AfA2026-PhysicalAI] AI-Enabled Helmet Detection–Based Safety Interlock System for Two-Wheelers

**Edge AI–based helmet detection system enforcing two-wheeler safety through automatic ignition interlock**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an **AI-powered, vision-based safety interlock system** that prevents a two-wheeler from starting unless the rider is wearing a helmet. A camera mounted on the vehicle captures the rider’s image, and an onboard AI model performs **real-time helmet detection**.
